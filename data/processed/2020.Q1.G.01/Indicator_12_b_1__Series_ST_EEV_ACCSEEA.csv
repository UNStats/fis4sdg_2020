Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts aims to establish a set of environmental accounts. \nThere are two waves of accounts. A first wave of accounts comprises environmental taxes, air emissions accounts and economy-wide material flow accounts. A second wave of accounts comprises environmental goods and services sector accounts, environmental protection expenditure accounts and physical energy flow accounts. Handbooks, manuals, questionnaires and compilation guidelines exist for all these accounts.\nThrough IPA 2017 Multi-beneficiary Statistical Cooperation Programme, Agency for statistics of BiH implemented pilot project 5.5 Environmental accounts.\n1.
