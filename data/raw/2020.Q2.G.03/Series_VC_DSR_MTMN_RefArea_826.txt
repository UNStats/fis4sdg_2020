However, the figures have to be used with caution because the numbers are aggregate estimates of the seasonal mortality excess and cannot be related to any specific cause of death in the individual cases. In addition, these estimates are independent of deaths caused by any actual disaster event in the wider sense, such as a flood, earthquake or industrial accident. Because of the relative nature of the EWM calculation, it is affected by the number of deaths that occurred in the non-winter comparator period as well as in the winter, while deaths from a specific disaster event may either increase or decrease the estimate depending on the time period in which the event occurred.']	C	NUMBER	G
