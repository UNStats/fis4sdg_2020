ST_EEV_ACCTSA	Implementation of standard accounting tools to monitor the economic and environmental aspects of tourism (Tourism Satellite Account tables)	300	Greece	2008.0	0	Float					Ministry of Tourism of Greece	"['During 2017 a Project for the compilation of the Greek Tourism Satellite Account was conducted within the framework of the EU-funded “Technical Assistance action to support tourism planning and policy for the promotion of sustainable tourism development in Greece” and in particular within the Activity I.1.1.: “Develop monitoring and reporting tools for Greek Tourism: a national accounting and statistical system”. The main output of this project is the production of Pilot TSA Tables 1 to 4 for the year 2015, together with the documentation of gaps and deficiencies of the actual TSA-relevant database and proposals for improvements, indicating the necessary steps towards a routine-wise implementation of TSA in Greece in the future.

The column “Other components of Tourism Consumption” is not compiled and needs to be determined and in particular the “Services associated with vacation accommodation on own account”, which are significant in the case of Greece.\n\nAs a result of this study, in September 2019, the Ministry of Tourism of Greece signed a four-year Memorandum of Understanding with the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) in order to compile in common the first basic Tables (1 το 4) of the Greek Tourism Satellite Account.

The aim is to create time series starting from year 2015 and proceed with the coming years so as to produce TSA- tables in a routine basis.  \n\nThe aforementioned MoU also provides for the setting up of two Joint Working Groups, consisting of Ministry and ELSTAT officials, willing to improve the quality of tourism statistics produced in Greece and to compile the TSA-Tables 1 to 4, as well.']"	C	NUMBER	G
