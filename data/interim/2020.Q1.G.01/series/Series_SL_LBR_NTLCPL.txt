Global and regional aggregates refer to the average of countries that have ratified both ILO Convention nos. 87 and 98 weighted by the labour force, based on ILO modelled estimates. These aggregates exclude non-ratifying countries as well as some countries without reliable information available, thus, they should be interpreted with caution. Countries excluded from the regional aggregate for Oceania are: Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Palau, Tonga and Tuvalu.\nSDG indicator 8.8.2 seeks to measure the level of national compliance with fundamental labour rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining). It is based on six International Labour Organization (ILO) supervisory body textual sources and also on national legislation. National law is not enacted for the purpose of generating a statistical indicator of compliance with fundamental rights, nor were any of the ILO textual sources created for this purpose. Indicator 8.8.2 is compiled from these sources and its use does not constitute a waiver of the respective ILO Constituentsâ divergent points of view on the sourcesâ conclusions. \nSDG indicator 8.8.2 is not intended as a tool to compare compliance among ILO member States. It should specifically be noted that reporting obligations of an ILO member State to the ILOâs supervisory system and thus ILO textual sources are different for ratifying and non-ratifying ILO member States.
