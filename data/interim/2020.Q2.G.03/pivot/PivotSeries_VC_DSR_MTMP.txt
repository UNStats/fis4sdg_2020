Some of the data has not finalized an official validation process and may be subject to revision at a later date.\nNote from the UK: The figures provided for the UK are based on excess winter mortality (EWM) in England and Wales. EWM is calculated using a methodology developed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), based on comparing the number of deaths which occurred in the winter period December to March (the coldest months in the UK) with the average number of deaths occurring in the preceding August to November and the following April to July. The calculation is explained in the annual bulletin which can be found on the ONS website: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/excesswintermortalityinenglandandwales/2018to2019provisionaland2017to2018final\nThis method has been used as a proxy for deaths due to disasters because the largest influence on year to year variation is believed to be the incidence of seasonal pandemic influenza. However, the figures have to be used with caution because the numbers are aggregate estimates of the seasonal mortality excess and cannot be related to any specific cause of death in the individual cases. In addition, these estimates are independent of deaths caused by any actual disaster event in the wider sense, such as a flood, earthquake or industrial accident. Because of the relative nature of the EWM calculation, it is affected by the number of deaths that occurred in the non-winter comparator period as well as in the winter, while deaths from a specific disaster event may either increase or decrease the estimate depending on the time period in which the event occurred.
